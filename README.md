UPDATE 1.5 is HERE:

IT HAS BEEN A WHILE, APPOLOGIES FOR UPDATING THE README. I kept forgetting to update it so since it has been a long time, I will push the bot's version to 1.5,

Welcome to NecroAtomic Bot Version 1.5,


Before I go any further, I would like to shoutout my co-contributor Gabe, once again, for adding more features, and for formatting and editing some of my messy code.


Here are some of the many featrues since the last update:

    - A Help Command, again thanks to Gabe, we were able to add in a dynamic help command
    - NecroAtomic Bot is proud is announce that we have a functioning music bot, be sure to use the music bot associated commands to jam to your favorite tunes
    - For Admins, I have added a lot of adminstrator features to ease your time in server management. Commands such as nuke, creation and deletion of             textchannels,adding and removing roles, server lockdown command, and more.
    - For some michaellaenous fun, I have added in a twitter, instagram, and urban dictionary command that lets you search for any account or term(urban) you like
    - I have added a per server prefix system but it is still currently in the testing phase and we are not too confident at the moment with it. 
   
That is all for this update, again shoutout to Gabe for helping me out,

Last but not least, here is a sneak preview at version 1.6 of NecroAtomic Bot,

    - Blacklisting commands, you will be able to blacklist certains words or phrases in your server
    - Improvements to the economy system, and to finalize a working prefix system
    - Improvements and changes to the music bot, and adding more featrues such as a playlist command and a shuffle command


Version 1.6 should debut sometime mid to end of spring, can't wait to see y'all there
